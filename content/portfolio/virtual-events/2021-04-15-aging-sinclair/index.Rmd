A fireside chat between Harvard Medical School professor and New York Times 
bestselling author Dr. David Sinclair and ISB Co-founder and Professor Dr. Lee 
Hood. Their wide ranging discussion covered the very latest in aging research.

ISB and Town Hall Seattle have put on a number of virtual events focusing on a 
range of important scientific issues. As Event Manager, my responsibilities
included talent booking, logistical production, speaker advancement and 
livestream execution.  

### Going Viral on YouTube  
The video of this event led to ISB's first ever viral moment on YouTube. In just 
over a month, the video achieved over 27,000 views. For reference: ISB's 
second highest video at the time had 24,000 views and was published 8 years 
prior(!) in 2013.  

> The YouTube video of this event has **60,000 views** at the time of writing  

Over 1,000 new subscribers to the ISB YouTube channel have come from this video 
alone-- an astonishing 27% of the channel's total subscribership. That is 
exponential growth for a YouTube channel that has existed since 2009.  

The video will continue raising awareness about ISB for years to come, 
which is remarkable and demonstrable ROI for an event that had minor expenses 
and overhead. It’s a great example of how to deliver a business operation that 
is cost-effective and scalable (virtual events), and then evolve it into 
something powerful and evergreen that will benefit an organization for years to 
come.
