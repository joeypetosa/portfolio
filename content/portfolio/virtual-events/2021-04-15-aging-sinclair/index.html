<p>ISB and Town Hall Seattle have put on a number of virtual events focusing on a
range of important scientific issues. As Event Manager, my responsibilities
included talent booking, logistical production, speaker advancement and
livestream execution.</p>

<h3>Going Viral on YouTube</h3>
<p>The video of this event led to ISB’s first ever viral moment on YouTube. In just
over a month, the video achieved over 27,000 views. For reference: ISB’s
second highest video at the time had 24,000 views and was published 8 years
prior(!) in 2013.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The YouTube video of this event has <strong>60,000 views</strong> at the time of writing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over 1,000 new subscribers to the ISB YouTube channel have come from this video
alone– an astonishing 27% of the channel’s total subscribership. That is
exponential growth for a YouTube channel that has existed since 2009.</p>
<p>The video will continue raising awareness about ISB for years to come,
which is remarkable and demonstrable ROI for an event that had minor expenses
and overhead. It’s a great example of how to deliver a business operation that
is cost-effective and scalable (virtual events), and then evolve it into
something powerful and evergreen that will benefit an organization for years to
come.</p>
