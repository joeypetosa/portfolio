## About:  
A fireside chat between Providence President and CEO Dr. Rod Hochman and ISB 
President and Professor Dr. Jim Heath. Their hour-long discussion explored how 
healthcare and science will be different after COVID-19. More about the event 
and program here: [How Will Healthcare and Scientific Research Be Different in a Post-Pandemic World?](https://isbscience.org/news/2021/01/28/how-will-healthcare-and-scientific-research-be-different-in-a-post-pandemic-world/).  

ISB and Town Hall Seattle have put on a number of virtual events focusing on a 
range of important scientific issues. As Event Manager, my responsibilities
included talent booking, logistical production, speaker advancement and 
livestream execution.
