## About:  
Dr. Temple Grandin was the keynote speaker in this iteration of the ISB-Town 
Hall Seattle Science Series. Grandin discussed her book – “The Outdoor 
Scientist: The Wonder of Observing the Natural World” – and a variety of other 
topics. ISB President Dr. Jim Heath joined at the end of her talk for a wide 
ranging Q&A discussion. More about the event and program here: 
[Dr. Temple Grandin and the Importance of Getting Kids Outside](https://isbscience.org/news/2021/06/11/dr-temple-grandin-and-the-importance-of-getting-kids-outside/).  

ISB and Town Hall Seattle have put on a number of virtual events focusing on a 
range of important scientific issues. As Event Manager, my responsibilities
included talent booking, logistical production, speaker advancement and 
livestream execution.
