## About:  
A fireside chat between longevity and aging researcher Dr. Nir Barzilai and ISB 
Co-founder and Professor Dr. Lee Hood. More about the event and program here:

ISB and Town Hall Seattle have put on a number of virtual events focusing on a 
range of important scientific issues. As Event Manager, my responsibilities
included talent booking, logistical production, speaker advancement and 
livestream execution.
