<h2>About:</h2>
<p>As Event Manager and Technical Director for ISB’s Virtual Microbiome Series, I
led the event’s core organizing team, ran production operations, and was
responsible for overall project management throughout the event’s lifecycle.</p>

<p>Event Evolution During a Pandemic: “A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When ISB, along with the rest of the world, had to cancel all of our in-person
events in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I saw an opportunity to try
something novel. It was clear that we needed to adapt our events for the present,
but we also needed to strengthen them for the future. I proposed an idea to one
of our faculty members: “Let’s host a virtual microbiome series.” He agreed,
and we haven’t looked back since.</p>
<p>Along with my faculty counterpart, I led an internal team of fifteen scientists
and administrative staff in organizing every facet of this series. I ran
bi-weekly project meetings, developed production schedules, advanced speakers,
scheduled code run-throughs, led dress-rehearsals, communicated with attendees
and was respsonible for onsite livestream production.</p>
<p>The series includes two events - an intensive computational course led by ISB
scientists and a symposium featuring prominent microbiome researchers from across
the world. Both events were virtual and free in order to make them as globally
accessible as possible. An internet connection was the only requirement to
participate. The intended audience was graduate students, postdocs, principal
investigators, industry scientists, educators, clinicians, or any other variety
of microbiome-curious person from across the globe.</p>

<h2>By the numbers</h2>
<p>We had remarkable growth in attendance for this series in the past two years.
We went from 713 registered attendees in 2020 to 2,274 in 2021, which is a
219% increase. There were 81 countries represented from around the world, as
well as 45 US states. I’ve provided some data visualizations below that outline
how successful this series was in 2021.</p>

<h2>Viral on YouTube</h2>
<p>Before October 13, 2021, 522 videos had been posted to ISB’s YouTube channel
since the channel’s inception in 2009. Those 522 videos had amassed 334,000
views total, which is an <strong>average of 640 views per video</strong>.</p>
<p>On October 13, 2021, we livestreamed day one of this series on YouTube. The main
platform where registered attendees viewed the program was Zoom Webinar.
However, I had decided to setup the YouTube livestream in case our audience had
any issues connecting to Zoom. A few days later, the views for this video
began exponentially increasing unlike anything the channel had seen before. In
nine days, our channel’s views were up 872% due to this video. The daily channel
views went from 340 to about 3,300. The video eclipsed 100,000 views within the
first 18 days of posting. It’s now sitting at <strong>139,000 views</strong> at the time of
this writing:</p>
