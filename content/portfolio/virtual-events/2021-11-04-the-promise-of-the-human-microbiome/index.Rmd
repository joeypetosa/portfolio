## About:  
The public extension of [ISB's 2021 Virtual Microbiome Series](https://www.joeypetosa.com/portfolio/virtual-events/microbiome-series/). 
The goal of this event was to raise awareness about an exciting field of 
research. More about the event and program here: [Dr. Jack Gilbert on the State of the Microbiome Field](https://isbscience.org/news/2021/11/16/dr-jack-gilbert-on-the-state-of-the-microbiome/).  

ISB and Town Hall Seattle have put on a number of virtual events focusing on a 
range of important scientific issues. As Event Manager, my responsibilities
included talent booking, logistical production, speaker advancement and 
livestream execution.
