## About:  
ISB President and Professor Dr. Jim Heath joined bestselling author and Pulitzer 
Prize winning New York Times reporter Matt Richtel in a virtual fireside chat. 
Richtel’s most recent nonfiction book ahead of this event was “An Elegant 
Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System.”  

ISB and Town Hall Seattle have put on a number of virtual events focusing on a 
range of important scientific issues. As Event Manager, my responsibilities
included talent booking, logistical production, speaker advancement and 
livestream execution.
