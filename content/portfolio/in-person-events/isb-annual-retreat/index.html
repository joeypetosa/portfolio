<h2>About:</h2>
<p>I have been the Event Manager for ISB’s organizational offsite retreat for the
past eight years, leading in development, production, and execution of
the annual 160 person two day event.</p>
<p>In 2014, I researched and visited venues across Washington State, presented my
findings to ISB leadership, and orchestrated a radical move of the retreat from
it’s long-time homes in the Hood Canal and Olympic Peninsula to Sleeping
Lady Resort in Leavenworth, WA. The change of venue was key in making this
annual event successful moving forward. Every year since 2014, I have partnered
with ISB’s President and leadership to generate retreat-specific goals and evolve
the event’s overall design. I also provide leadership to a 20 person retreat
committee in developing programmatic elements, and a 10 person production crew
in onsite execution. Some of the activities at this overnight retreat have
included external keynotes, internal presentations and group sessions, working
lunches, poster sessions, evening social/entertainment and achievement
recognition.</p>
<p>My responsibilities have included project and budget management, contract
negotiations with venue and vendors, registration management, speaker advance,
food and beverage management, attendee and staff management, AV production and
post event evaluation and reporting.</p>
