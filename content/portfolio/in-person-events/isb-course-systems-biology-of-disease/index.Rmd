## About:
I have been the Event Manager for ISB's annual Systems Biology of Disease Summer 
Course since 2014, driving event strategy, technical production, and execution 
of the weeklong event.  

>**Interesting note:** the use of R programming in this course is what sparked my 
interest in Data Analytics.

The goal of the ISB summer course  is to introduce the core concepts of systems 
biology and their application to systems biomedicine. Participants gain 
experience using systems biology approaches that allow them to carry out 
personalized medicine. Participants include graduate students, postdoctoral 
fellows, biomedical researchers, educators and principal investigators who have 
an interest in systems biomedicine.  

Our course instructors provided daily hands-on training that walked students 
through R code. These computational sessions focused on unsupervised machine 
learning, supervised machine learning, single-cell analysis and gene regulatory 
network inference.  

My responsibilities have included project and budget management, event timeline 
stewardship, registration management, speaker advance, vendor selection and 
negotiation, attendee and staff management, event marketing and post event 
evaluation and reporting.
