<h2>About:</h2>
<p>I have been the Event Manager for ISBâ€™s annual Systems Biology of Disease Summer
Course since 2014, driving event strategy, technical production, and execution
of the weeklong event.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interesting note:</strong> the use of R programming in this course is what sparked my
interest in Data Analytics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal of the ISB summer course is to introduce the core concepts of systems
biology and their application to systems biomedicine. Participants gain
experience using systems biology approaches that allow them to carry out
personalized medicine. Participants include graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, biomedical researchers, educators and principal investigators who have
an interest in systems biomedicine.</p>
<p>Our course instructors provided daily hands-on training that walked students
through R code. These computational sessions focused on unsupervised machine
learning, supervised machine learning, single-cell analysis and gene regulatory
network inference.</p>
<p>My responsibilities have included project and budget management, event timeline
stewardship, registration management, speaker advance, vendor selection and
negotiation, attendee and staff management, event marketing and post event
evaluation and reporting.</p>
