</ul>
<p>As Event Manager, my scope included budget and stakeholder management, overall
project management, vendor selection and negotiation, cross-functional
collaboration with Communication, Development, Leadership and Scientific groups
within ISB to ensure successful execution of event program.</p>
<p>The symposium was free to the public and had over 160 in attendance. The birthday
celebration was a private event hosted at <a href="https://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/">Chihuly Garden and Glass</a>, and included a dinner, roast
and concert with over 200 people in attendance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>“I thought the symposium was one of the best that ISB has ever had. Each of
the speakers were superb in their own unique ways and we had a very broad view
of where science is going,” Lee said. “This 80th birthday was the best I have
ever had. The Chihuly setting was breathtaking; the people spanned from my
earliest days in science right up until today; the roasts were wonderful – saying
more about the speakers than about me and the interactions of all of us
with one another were marred only by the fact they were all too brief. I cannot
imagine a better birthday celebration.”</em></strong></p>
