## About  
A symposium and party held in honor of Dr. Lee Hood’s 80th birthday. [Dr. Hood](https://isbscience.org/bio/leroy-hood/), a pioneer in the field of 
biotechnology and recipient of the National Medal of Science in 2011, is 
co-founder and chief strategy officer of ISB.

As Event Manager, my scope included budget and stakeholder management, overall 
project management, vendor selection and negotiation, cross-functional 
collaboration with Communication, Development, Leadership and Scientific groups 
within ISB to ensure successful execution of event program.

The symposium was free to the public and had over 160 in attendance. The birthday 
celebration was a private event hosted at [Chihuly Garden and Glass](https://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/), and included a dinner, roast 
and concert with over 200 people in attendance.  

>***“I thought the symposium was one of the best that ISB has ever had. Each of 
the speakers were superb in their own unique ways and we had a very broad view 
of where science is going,” Lee said. "This 80th birthday was the best I have 
ever had. The Chihuly setting was breathtaking; the people spanned from my 
earliest days in science right up until today; the roasts were wonderful -- saying 
more about the speakers than about me and the interactions of all of us 
with one another were marred only by the fact they were all too brief. I cannot 
imagine a better birthday celebration."***
