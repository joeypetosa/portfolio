<p>In this case study, I analyze historical data from a Chicago based bike-share
company in order to identify trends in how their customers use bikes differently.
The main tools I use are spreadsheets, SQL and Tableau. Here are the highlights:</p>

</ul>
<p>A more in-depth breakdown of the case study scenario is included below, followed
by my full report.<br />
<br></p>
<div id="scenario" class="section level3">
<h3>Scenario</h3>
<p>Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago with two types of customers.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are known as <strong>casual riders</strong>,
while those who purchase annual memberships are known as <strong>members</strong>. Cyclistic’s
financial analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders. The director of marketing believes the company’s future
success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.</p>
<p>The marketing analytics team wants to understand how casual riders and annual
members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will
design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
The primary stakeholders for this project include Cyclistic’s director of
marketing and the Cyclistic executive team. The Cyclistic marketing analytics
team are secondary stakeholders.</p>

<div id="defining-the-problem" class="section level2">
<h2>Defining the problem</h2>
<p>The main problem for the director of marketing and marketing analytics team is
this: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting Cyclistic’s casual riders
into annual members. There are three questions that will guide this future
marketing program. For my scope on this project, I will anlyze the first
question:</p>
<p><em>1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?</em><br />
2) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?<br />
3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become
members?</p>
<p>By looking at the data, we will be able to first get a broad sense of certain
patterns that are occurring in the two different groups. Understanding the
differences will provide more accurate customer profiles for each group. These
insights will help the marketing analytics team design high quality targeted
marketing for converting casual riders into members. For the Cyclistic executive
team, these insights will help Cyclistic maximize the number of annual members
and will fuel future growth for the company.</p>

<h2>Data sources</h2>
<p>We’ll be using Cyclistic’s historical bike trip data from the last 12 months,
which is publicly available <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">here</a>.
The data is made available by Motivate International Inc. under this <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">license</a>. The data is stored
in spreadsheets. There are 12 .CSV files total:</p>
<pre><code>01) 2021-02_divvy_trip-data.csv  
02) 2021-03_divvy_trip-data.csv  
03) 2021-04_divvy_trip-data.csv  
04) 2021-05_divvy_trip-data.csv  
05) 2021-06_divvy_trip-data.csv  
06) 2021-07_divvy_trip-data.csv  
07) 2021-08_divvy_trip-data.csv  
08) 2021-09_divvy_trip-data.csv  
09) 2021-10_divvy_trip-data.csv  
10) 2021-11_divvy_trip-data.csv  
11) 2021-12_divvy_trip-data.csv  
12) 2022-01_divvy_trip-data.csv  </code></pre>
<p>It is structured data, organized in rows (records) and columns (fields). Each
record represents one trip, and each trip has a unique field that identifies it:
<code>ride_id</code>. Each trip is anonymized and includes the following fields:</p>
<pre><code>* ride_id               #Ride id - unique
* rideable_type         #Bike type - Classic, Docked, Electric
* started_at            #Trip start day and time
* ended_at              #Trip end day and time
* start_station_name    #Trip start station
* start_station_id      #Trip start station id
* end_station_name      #Trip end station
* end_station_id        #Trip end station id
* start_lat             #Trip start latitude  
* start_lng             #Trip start longitute   
* end_lat               #Trip end latitude  
* end_lat               #Trip end longitute   
* member_casual         #Rider type - Member or Casual  </code></pre>
<p>Bike station data that is made publicly available by the <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/narr/foia/data_disclaimer.html" target="_blank">city of Chicago</a>
will also be used. It can be downloaded <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Bicycle-Stations/bbyy-e7gq/data" target="_blank">here</a>. In terms of bias and credibility, both data sources we are using ROCCC:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reliable and original:</strong> this is public data that contains accurate,
complete and unbiased info on Cyclistic’s historical bike trips. It can be used
to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive and current:</strong> these sources contain all the data needed to
understand the different ways members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes. The
data is from the past 12 months. It is current and relevant to the task at hand.
This is important because the usefulness of data decreases as time passes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cited:</strong>these sources are publicly available data provided by Cyclistic and
the City of Chicago. Governmental agency data and vetted public data are
typically good sources of data.</p></li>

<h2>Data cleaning and manipulation</h2>
<div id="microsoft-excel-initial-data-cleaning-and-manipulation" class="section level3">
<h3>Microsoft Excel: initial data cleaning and manipulation</h3>
<p>Our next step is making sure the data is stored appropriately and prepared for
analysis. After downloading all 12 zip files and unzipping them, I housed the
files in a temporary folder on my desktop. I also created subfolders for the
.CSV files and the .XLS files so that I have a copy of the original data.
Then, I launched Excel, opened each file, and chose to Save As an Excel Workbook
file. For each .XLS file, I did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed format of <code>started_at</code> and <code>ended_at</code> columns
<ul>
<li>Formatted as custom <code>DATETIME</code><br />
</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Custom &gt; yyyy-mm-dd h:mm:ss</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Created a column called <code>ride_length</code>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the length of each ride by subtracting the column <code>started_at</code>
from the column <code>ended_at</code> (example: <code>=D2-C2</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>Formatted as <code>TIME</code><br />
</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Time &gt; HH:MM:SS (37:30:55)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Created a column called <code>ride_date</code>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the date of each ride started using the <code>DATE</code> command
(example: <code>=DATE(YEAR(C2),MONTH(C2),DAY(C2))</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Date &gt; YYYY-MM-DD</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Created a column called <code>ride_month</code>
<ul>
<li>Entered the month of each ride and formatted as number (example: January: <code>=1</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Number</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Created a column called <code>ride_year</code>
<ul>
<li>Entered the year of each ride and formatted as general<br />
</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; General &gt; YYYY</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Created a column called <code>start_time</code>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the start time of each ride using the <code>started_at</code> column</li>
<li>Formatted as <code>TIME</code><br />
</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Time &gt; HH:MM:SS (37:30:55)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Created a column called <code>end_time</code>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the end time of each ride using the <code>ended_at</code> column<br />
</li>
<li>Formatted as <code>TIME</code><br />
</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Time &gt; HH:MM:SS (37:30:55)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Created a column called <code>day_of_week</code>
<ul>
<li>Calculated the day of the week that each ride started using the <code>WEEKDAY</code>
command (example: <code>=WEEKDAY(C2,1)</code>)<br />
</li>
<li>Formatted as a <code>NUMBER</code> with no decimals<br />
</li>
<li>Format &gt; Cells &gt; Number (no decimals) &gt; 1,2,3,4,5,6,7<br />
</li>
<li>Note: 1 = Sunday and 7 = Saturday</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>After making these updates, I saved each .XLS file as a new .CSV file.</p>
</div>
<div id="bigquery-further-data-cleaning-and-manipulation-via-sql" class="section level3">
<h3>BigQuery: further data cleaning and manipulation via SQL</h3>
<p>Since these datasets are so large, it makes sense to move our analysis to a tool
that is better suited for handling large datasets. I chose to use SQL via <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">BigQuery</a>.</p>
<p>In order to continue processing the data in BigQuery, I created a bucket in
Google Cloud Storage to upload all 12 files. I then created a project in
BigQuery and uploaded these files as datasets. I’ve provided my initial cleaning
and transformation SQL queries here for reference: <a href="https://github.com/joeypetosa/cyclistic_cs/blob/3331e54abf16dbdb379bd71366bc27185ecd0006/initial_setup_query.sql" target="_blank">initial_setup_query.sql</a></p>
<p>The results from the <code>COUNT DISTINCT</code> query for each table are very interesting.
We can see that the three summer months have the highest trip counts, followed
by alternating spring and fall months before ending with winter months:</p>

<div id="create-quarterly-tables" class="section level4">
<h4>Create quarterly tables</h4>
<p>In order to perform analysis by season, let’s combine these tables. We’ll
create Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 tables for analysis. We’ll have two Q1 tables– one
for 20221 and one for 2022 – since we have FEB/MAR data from 2021 and JAN data
from 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table 1) 2021_Q1 -&gt; FEB(02), MAR(03)</li>
<li>Table 2) 2021_Q2 -&gt; APR(04), MAY(05), JUN(06)</li>
<li>Table 3) 2021_Q3 -&gt; JUL(07), AUG(08), SEP(09)</li>
<li>Table 4) 2021_Q4 -&gt; OCT(10), NOV(11), DEC(12)</li>
<li>Table 5) 2022_Q1 -&gt; JAN(01)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll first create 2021_Q2 and then repeat for the remaining four tables:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/2c7c2e6ae2ceb635a6d6360f24812ef2.js"></script>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="clean-and-transform-day-of-week" class="section level4">
<h4>Clean and transform day of week</h4>
<p>Some additional data cleaning is needed on the new table. First, we’ll update
the format for <code>day_of_week</code> from <code>FLOAT</code> to <code>STRING</code>. Then, we’ll change the
values from numbers to their corresponding day names (i.e. 1 = Sunday, 7 =
Saturday. We’ll start with 2021_Q1 and repeat for the remaining four tables:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/1938c8e6ef62a94c439384f33a3fd000.js"></script>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="delete-old-tables" class="section level4">
<h4>Delete old tables</h4>
<p>Now that we have our tables organized into quarters, we can delete the original
monthly tables from BigQuery. We no longer need the monthly tables since the
data is available in the quarter tables. Also, it costs money to store these
datasets in BigQuery.</p>
<p><br></p>

<div id="analysis-1-exploratory" class="section level2">
<h2>Analysis #1: Exploratory</h2>
<div id="q1---quarterly-data-exploration" class="section level3">
<h3>2021_Q1 - quarterly data exploration</h3>
<p>We’ll select a few columns from 2021_Q1 to preview in a temporary table. This
will help give us an idea of potential trends and relationships to explore
further:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/a5d6d670be6d09f5c71328571b1bbfdf.js"></script>
<p><img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-preview.png" alt="2021_Q1 data preview"></p>
<p>The above query returned 278,119 rows. That is the number of recorded trips we
have data for in this quarter. Let’s dive deeper into those trip totals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="total-trips" class="section level4">
<h4>Total trips</h4>
<p>We’ll create total columns for overall, annual members and casual riders. We’ll
also calculate percentages of overall total for both types:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/dff34920d6ea0ed9de2cee7a12588278.js"></script>
<p><img align=center width=500px src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-trip-totals.png" alt="2021_Q1 trip totals"></p>
<p>Of the 278,118 total trips in 2021_Q1, 66% were from annual members while 34% were from casual riders.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="average-ride-lengths" class="section level4">
<h4>Average ride lengths</h4>
<p>How does average <code>ride_length</code> differ for these groups?</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/faa11589551287ca2e0276fccc7ebc5b.js"></script>
<p><img align=center width=500px src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-avg-rl.png" alt="2021_Q1 AVG ride lengths"></p>
<p>We can see that casual riders average about 23 more minutes per ride. That seems
like a pretty big difference. What influence are outliers having on these
averages? Let’s investigate.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="max-ride-lengths" class="section level4">
<h4>Max ride lengths</h4>
<p>We’ll look at the maximum values for <code>ride_length</code> to see if anything extreme is
influencing the casual rider average:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/69af8c9f44e83709643bfb1ccc7aac2f.js"></script>
<p><img align="center" width = 250px src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-max-rl.png" alt="2021_Q1 MAX ride lengths"></p>
<p>As we suspected, the casual riders average <code>ride_length</code> was significantly
impacted by at least one outlier. The longest trip duration for casual riders
was 528 hours, or 22 days. Meanwhile, the longest for annual was about 26 hours.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the top 100 highest <code>ride_length</code> values for casual riders
to confirm there is more than one outlier affecting the average:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/ae2b1fc8b00efdf24ab644bb94af40f6.js"></script>
<p><img align=center width=500px src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-max-rl-casual-100.gif" alt="2021_Q1 MAX ride lengths, casual riders top 100"></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="median-ride-lengths" class="section level4">
<h4>Median ride lengths</h4>
<p>Since there are more than a few outliers impacting the average, we’re going to
use median instead of average. Median will be more accurate for our analysis:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/dff8d1c0ea3ef8ec6a78c77a879d0b7c.js"></script>
<p><img align=center width=300px src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-median-rl.png" alt="2021_Q1 median ride lengths"></p>
<p>Now we see a much closer number, with 18 minutes for casual riders and 10 minutes for annual members.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="busiest-day-for-rides" class="section level4">
<h4>Busiest day for rides</h4>
<p>Let’s see which day has the most rides for annual members and casual riders:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/e2d6dc494dea55d518922fe60fef7df8.js"></script>
<p><img align=center width=300px src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-mode-day-of-week.png" alt="2021_Q1 mode day of week"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Saturday is the most popular day for both annual members and casual riders.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="median-ride-length-per-day" class="section level4">
<h4>Median ride length per day</h4>
<p>Let’s look at the median ride lengths per day for both annual members and casual
riders. Since Saturday is the most popular overall, do we think it will also
have the highest median ride length?</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/02002d2ac07a2b20aa654de9a1158a85.js"></script>
<p><img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-median-day-of-week.png" alt="2021_Q1 median ride length, day of week, casual and member"></p>
<p>Very interesting! The median ride length for casual riders on the top five days
(SUN, SAT, MON, TUE, WED) is nearly double the amount for annual members on
their top five days (SAT, SUN, MON, TUE, WED).</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="total-rides-per-day" class="section level4">
<h4>Total rides per day</h4>
<p>Let’s look at total rides per day. We’ll create columns for overall total,
annual members and casual riders:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/7467836562044c37e5247280ff77e60c.js"></script>
<p><img align=center width=350px src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-trips-per-day.png" alt="2021_Q1 number of trips per day"></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="start-stations" class="section level4">
<h4>Start stations</h4>
<p>Next, we’ll look at the most popular start stations for trips. We’ll again
include columns for overall, annual member and casual rider totals per start
station:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joeypetosa/cd9d64989e2a8ec76e518907f97e461d.js"></script>
<p><img align=center width=350px src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-start-stations.png" alt="2021_Q1 start stations"></p>
<p>We can begin to see some interesting patterns in the start station data. It
looks like casual riders and annual members tend to favor different regions
for beginning their trips. By updating the <code>ORDER BY</code> function to sort by
<code>casual DESC</code> and <code>member DESC</code> in two separate queries, we can compare the
top ten start stations for both:</p>
<p><img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/2021-q1-start-station-comparison.png" alt="2021_Q1 start stations"></p>
<p>Wow! There is only one start station that cracks the top ten for both lists.<br />
The <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/W+Elm+St+%26+N+Clark+St,+Chicago,+IL+60610/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x880fd34f04679fd7:0xfcb6443483c236c3?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiS7_n4zIr2AhWCJzQIHQS-C9gQ8gF6BAgIEAE">Clark St &amp; Elm St</a>
start station is ranked #1 for annual members and #10 for casual riders. The
casual riders seem to favor stations near the water like <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/S+Lake+Shore+Dr+%26+E+Monroe+St,+Chicago,+IL+60601/@41.8809363,-87.61969,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x880e2b58c766aa85:0x6a3ce76eb41e58c6!8m2!3d41.8809363!4d-87.617496">Lake Shore Dr &amp; Monroe St</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/E+Grand+Ave+%26+N+Streeter+Dr,+Chicago,+IL+60611/@41.8921227,-87.6122317,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x880e2b525e10ee6d:0x1c44bc2bc0376a7!8m2!3d41.8921227!4d-87.610043">Streeter Dr &amp; Grand Ave</a>, while
annual members frequent start stations in the River North neighborhood like
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/W+Erie+St+%26+N+Dearborn+St,+Chicago,+IL+60654/@41.8940553,-87.6319277,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x880e2cb2bff8e189:0x102f5d20351b9226!8m2!3d41.8940553!4d-87.629739">Dearborn St &amp; Erie St</a>

<p>An initial hypothesis for casual riders could be that they tend to favor start
stations near the water and close to tourist attractions because they use bikes
for weekend entertainment. An initial hypothesis for annual members could be
that they tend to favor start stations in downtown, retail areas because they
are using bikes for their work commutes and shopping trips.</p>

<p>In order to analyze all twelve months together, we’ll combine the five
quarterly tables into one table. The queries used to accomplish this
are included <a href="https://github.com/joeypetosa/cyclistic_cs/blob/main/setup_full_year.sql" target="_blank">here</a>
for reference. I’ve also provided the SQL file used for full year analysis: <a href="https://github.com/joeypetosa/cyclistic_cs/blob/main/analysis_full_year.sql" target="_blank">analysis_full_year.sql</a>.</p>
<p>For a summary and overall visualization of my full year analysis, please visit the
Tableau Public dashboard I created here: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticBikeshareinChicago/CyclisticBikeshareinChicago?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">Tableau Dashboard: Cyclistic Bikeshare in Chicago</a>.<br />
I will also highlight some of the interesting trends and relationships I discovered
below.</p>
</div>
<div id="annual-members-vs-casual-riders" class="section level3">
<h3>Annual Members vs Casual Riders</h3>
<p><img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/ccs-summary-area-chart.png" alt="member vs casual"><br />
During the past 12 months, annual members accounted for 55% of Cyclistic’s total
trips while casual riders accounted for 45% of total trips. As we can see in the
above area chart, this percentage fluctuates throughout the year.</p>
</div>
<div id="seasonal-trends" class="section level3">
<h3>Seasonal trends</h3>
<p><img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/ccs-quarterly-total-trips.svg" alt="quarterly trip totals"></p>
<div id="summer-vs-winter" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Summer vs Winter</em></h4>
<p>The busiest time of year for overall bike trips is Q3– July, August and
September. This makes sense because these months are mainly summer time. Bike
riding is better suited for warmer weather, which is also why we see a major
drop-off in total rides during the winter months of Q1– January, February and
March.</p>
<p>Annual members outnumbered casual riders in every quarter except Q3.
Interestingly, the annual members nearly doubled the casual ridership in Q1 and
Q4 while only slightly edging them out in Q2.</p>
</div>
<div id="median-ride-length" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Median ride length</em></h4>
<p>We learned in the earlier quarterly analysis that the average <code>ride_length</code> for
casual riders was significantly impacted by outliers, so median is a more
accurate measurement for our analysis:<br />
<img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/ccs-summary-median-rl.svg" alt="median ride lengths"></p>
<p>We can see that casual riders consistently have longer rides than annual members.</p>
</div>
<div id="day-of-week" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Day of week</em></h4>
<p>Which days of the week have the highest number of rides for casual riders vs
annual members? Let’s look at the mode for each quarter and for the full year:</p>
<p><img align=center width=500px src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/ccs-summary-mode-day.png" alt="most popular days of week for rides"></p>
<p>Casual riders were extremely consistent, with <strong>Saturday</strong> revealing itself as
their preferred day of week for each quarter and across the full year. Meanwhile,
the annual members looked to favor the middle of the week for their bike use. The
most popular day for them acrosss the full year was <strong>Wednesday</strong>. Let’s see how
the total rides for each day stack up for both groups:</p>
<p><img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/ccs-summary-trips-per-day.svg" alt="total rides per day of week over full year"></p>
<p>How about median ride length per day of week for both groups?</p>
<p><img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/ccs-summary-median-rl-per-day.svg" alt="median ride lengths per day of week"></p>
<p>A few fascinating insights from the above chart:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>U-shape pattern</strong><br />
Sunday and Saturday are favored by both groups for longer
rides, while ride duration decreases towards the middle of the week before
increasing again on Friday. This results in a u-shape trend for both groups in
the above chart, although it is much more dramatic for casual riders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Range differences</strong><br />
For annual members, difference between their longest day
and their shortest day is 1 minute and 44 seconds. For casual riders,
difference is 4 minute and 57 seconds. That is a 185.58% increase in
difference for casual riders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual members: day-to-day consistency</strong><br />
The annual members may have shorter ride lengths when compared to casual
riders, but they are extremely consistent with their bike use day-over-day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Casual riders: weekend warriors</strong><br />
The daily median ride length for casual riders is consistently higher than
that of annual members. The range of their ride length duration varies at a
greater amount than that of annual members. Sundays and Saturdays stand out
as their longest ride days.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="bike-type" class="section level4">
<h4>Bike type</h4>
<p>Do members and casual riders have different preferences for bike type? Are
classic bikes more popular than electric bikes?</p>
<p><img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/ccs-summary-rides-by-type.svg" alt="total rides by bike type over full year"></p>
<p>We can see that classic bikes are favored by both groups. Let’s look at the
percentages of bike type use within each group:</p>
<p><img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/ccs-summary-bike-type-group-percentage.svg" alt="group percentages of rides by bike type over full year"></p>
<p>Looking at the above, we might ask what exactly is a docked bike and why are only
casual riders using them?</p>
<p><img align=center src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/joeypetosa.com/portfolio/cyclistic-cs/ccs-summary-bike-type-avg-and-max-rl.png" alt="bike type average and max ride lengths"></p>
<p>We can now see from the above charts that docked bikes are the culprit for the
outliers affecting our ride length averages from earlier in our analysis. This is
something we should discuss with our team further and address.</p>
</div>
<div id="start-and-end-station-use" class="section level4">
<h4>Start and end station use</h4>
<p>In the Tableau Dashboard I created, which is again available <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticBikeshareinChicago/CyclisticBikeshareinChicago?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">here</a>, there is a worksheet that
allows the exploration of start and end station use by members, casual riders
and combined overall rides. The snapshot below is from the overall view.
While interacting with the dashboard, we can see that casual riders have
a higher max than annual members. Annual members have a lower max, but we
can see more colors represented across the member map versus the consistent
coloring across the casual map. This tells us that rides by members are more
distributed across stations while rides by casual riders are more top heavy in
that a huge chunk are happening at the same few stations.</p>
