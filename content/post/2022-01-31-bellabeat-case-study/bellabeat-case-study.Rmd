[Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/about/) is the go-to wellness brand for women with an ecosystem of products and services that focuses on womenâ€™s health. They empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits by collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health. In this case study, I analyze smart device fitness data that could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.
