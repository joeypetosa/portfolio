Learning and applying new technical skills has been a major priority throughout my career. These technical skills help me take my work to the next level analytically, creatively and operationally. In fact, I built this website myself using RStudio, Blogdown, Hugo, GitHub, Netlify and AWS. Feel free to check out my website repository <a href="https://github.com/joeypetosa/portfolio" target="_blank">here</a>. My technical skills are listed below.

**Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate:** In order to strengthen my skills as a data analyst, I recently completed the 8-course Google Data Analytics Certificate offered by Coursera-- a rigorous, hands-on program that covers the entire scope of the data analysis process.
