Learning and applying new technical skills has been a major priority throughout my career. These technical skills help me take my work to the next level analytically, creatively and operationally. I even built this website myself using RStudio, Blogdown, Hugo, GitHub, Netlify and AWS. Feel free to check out my website repository <a href="https://github.com/joeypetosa/portfolio" target="_blank">here</a>.
