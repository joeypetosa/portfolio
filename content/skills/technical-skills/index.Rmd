Learning and applying new technical skills has been a major priority throughout my career. These technical skills help me take my work to the next level analytically, creatively and operationally. In fact, I built this website myself using RStudio, Blogdown, Hugo, GitHub, Netlify and AWS. Feel free to check out my website repository <a href="https://github.com/joeypetosa/portfolio" target="_blank">here</a>. My technical skills are listed at the end of this page.

**Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Issued by Coursera:** In order to strengthen my skills as a data analyst, I completed the 8-course Google Data Analytics Certificate program offered by Coursera.
